        <p class="govuk-body">
          You should only use this service if you are moving animals from one of
          these origins:
        </p>
        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
          <li>TB restricted farm</li>
          <li>
            approved finishing unit (AFU), including enhanced with grazing
            (AFUE)
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="govuk-body">
          And they are going to one of these destinations:
        </p>
        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
          <li>slaughter</li>
          <li>dedicated sale for TB (orange market)</li>
          <li>
            approved finishing unit (AFU), including enhanced with grazing
            (AFUE)
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="govuk-body">
          If you are moving animals from a TB restricted farm to slaughter, you
          do not need to use this service to apply for a licence.
        </p>
        <p class="govuk-body">
          You should have a general licence in the information pack sent to you
          from the Animal and Plant Health Agency (APHA). The pack was posted to
          you when your herd was placed under TB restriction.
        </p>
        <p class="govuk-body">

        <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Before you start</h3>
        <p class="govuk-body">Licences cannot be assessed or issued if:</p>
        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
          <li>reactors are still on your farm or premises</li>
          <li>cattle are awaiting skin or blood test results</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="govuk-body">
          Contact your vet if you are unsure whether the tests have been sent.
          If APHA has not received the tests, there could be delays in
          processing your licence.
        </p>
        <p class="govuk-body">
          To apply for a licence, you need the following information:
        </p>
        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
          <li>name of the County Parish Holding (CPH) owner</li>
          <li>
            County Parish Holding (CPH) number and address where the animals are
            moving from
          </li>
          <li>
            where the animals are moving to, for example the type of market
          </li>
          <li>email address to send the licence to</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="govuk-body">
          It can take up to 5 working days to process your application. It may
          take longer if veterinary checks are required, or we need further
          information.
