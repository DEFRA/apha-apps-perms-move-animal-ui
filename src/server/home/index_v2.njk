        <p class="govuk-body">
          You can use this service to apply for a Bovine Tuberculosis (TB)
          movement licence.
        </p>
        <p class="govuk-body">
          Before animals move onto or off a farm or premises with TB
          restrictions, you must apply for a licence with the Animal and Plant
          Health Agency (APHA).

          Moving animals off a TB restricted farm to go to slaughter
        </h2>
        <p class="govuk-body">
          If you are moving animals from a TB restricted farm to slaughter, you
          do not need to use this service to apply for a licence.
        </p>
        <p class="govuk-body">
          You should have a general licence in the information pack sent to you
          from APHA. The pack was posted to you when your herd was placed under
          TB restriction.
        </p>
        <p class="govuk-body">This licence allows you to move animals:</p>
        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
          <li>from a TB restricted farm direct to slaughter</li>
          <li>
            via a slaughter gathering/ red market (if the licence was issued
            after 30 September 2024)
          </li>
        </ul>

          Moving animals onto a TB restricted farm
        </h2>
        <p class="govuk-body">
          If your farm or premises is not under TB restrictions and animals are
          moving onto a TB restricted farm, it is the responsibility of the TB
          restricted farm to apply for a licence. We need details about their
          biosecurity practices to process the licence.
        </p>
        <p class="govuk-body">

        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Before you start</h2>
        <p class="govuk-body">Licences cannot be assessed or issued if:</p>
        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
          <li>reactors are still on your farm or premises</li>
          <li>cattle are awaiting skin or blood test results</li>
          <li>TB testing is overdue</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="govuk-body">
          Contact your vet if you are unsure whether the tests have been sent.
          If APHA has not received the tests, there could be delays in
          processing your licence.
        </p>
        <p class="govuk-body">
          To apply for a licence, you need the following information:
        </p>
        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
          <li>name of the County Parish Holding (CPH) owner</li>
          <li>
            County Parish Holding (CPH) number and address where the animals are
            moving from
          </li>
          <li>
            where the animals are moving to, for example the type of market
          </li>
          <li>email address to send the licence to</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="govuk-body">
          It can take up to 5 working days to process your application. It may
          take longer if veterinary checks are required, or we need further
          information.
