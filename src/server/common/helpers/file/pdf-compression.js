 *   - {Buffer} file: The resulting buffer after compression (or the original buffer if no compression was applied).
 *   - {number} start: The timestamp (in milliseconds) when the compression process started.
 *   - {number} end: The timestamp (in milliseconds) when the compression process ended.
 *   - {number} duration: The duration (in milliseconds) of the compression process.
 *   - {number} originalSize: The size (in bytes) of the original buffer.
 *   - {number} reduction: The percentage reduction in file size after compression.
 *   - {number} size: The size (in bytes) of the resulting buffer.
