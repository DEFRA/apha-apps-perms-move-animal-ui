      <p>
        Animals that enter a TB breakdown herd and are later removed as TB
        reactors or direct contacts before the herd is officially TB-free will
        receive a 50% reduction in compensation.

      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>
          the destination herd is registered to a bovine Tb health scheme.
          Accreditation from the Cattle Health Certification Standards (CHECS)
          must be in place before the breakdown began
        </li>

          the cattle are moving to any type of approved or licenced finishing
