    You should have a general licence in the information pack sent to you from
    the Animal and Plant Health Agency (APHA). The pack was posted to you when
    your herd was placed under TB restriction.
  </p>

  <p>
    This licence allows you to move animals from a TB restricted farm to
    slaughter.
  </p>

  <p>
    If you do not have a general licence, you can continue to apply for a new
    one.
